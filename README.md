Can't afford drive, here is everything I explored (and quite frankly hoarded) over the course of my academic years. As I've worked with NLP most, and learned to implement ML and DL through books, videos, articles and full fledged courses to save money, I hope this is helpful to y'all too. I plan to make this easily navigatable as soon as possible. Apologies for the mess!
